The Explanation of HTTP and how we can use it

HTTP Stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. It is a Protocol that is mainly used for communication on the internet.
It specifies a set of rules  that must be followed. 

HTTP as a Stateless protocol

As a stateless protocol, once a request is sent and received on the server, it is discarded and forgotten on the server i.e the Memory ogf previous request is not saved 
HTTP usually consists of two Types of Headers: 
Request Header
Response Header
 The contents of a header such as Accept, Authorize, Content Length and Pay Load etc.


HTTP functions as a request–response protocol in the client–server computing model. A web browser, for example, may be the client and an application running on a computer hosting a website may be the server. The client submits an HTTP request message to the server. The server, which provides resources such as HTML files and other content, or performs other functions on behalf of the client, returns a response message to the client. The response contains completion status information about the request and may also contain requested content in its message body.

A web browser is an example of a user agent (UA). Other types of user agent include the indexing software used by search providers (web crawlers), voice browsers, mobile apps, and other software that accesses, consumes, or displays web content.

HTTP uses a server-client model. A client, for example, may be a home computer, laptop, or mobile device. The HTTP server is typically a web host running web server software, such as Apache or IIS. When you access a website, your browser sends a request to the corresponding web server and it responds with an HTTP status code. If the URL is valid and the connection is granted, the server will send your browser the webpage and related files.

Some common HTTP status codes include:

    200 - successful request (the webpage exists)
    301 - moved permanently (often forwarded to a new URL)
    401 - unauthorized request (authorization required)
    403 - forbidden (access is not allowed to the page or directory)
    500 - internal server error (often caused by an incorrect server configuration)

HTTP also defines commands such as GET and POST, which are used to handle form submissions on websites. The CONNECT command is used to facilitate a secure connection that is encrypted using SSL. Encrypted HTTP connections take place over HTTPS, an extension of HTTP designed for secure data transmissions.

NOTE: URLs that begin with "http://" are accessed over the standard hypertext transfer protocol and use port 80 by default. URLs that start with "https://" are accessed over a secure HTTPS connection and often use port 443.
